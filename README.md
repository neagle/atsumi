atsumi
======

A static site generator for Nate Eagle. Atsumi is the term in japanese go for [thickness](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Thickness), or a strong position without weaknesses. Thickness is something that's hard to appreciate when you're starting out - where's the value? How does this get me territory? But it becomes more and more important to your game, the stronger you get.

Static sites are thick: they don't rely on a database, so they're portable, easy on your web server, and easy to integrate into other build processes.

There are a million billion static site generators on the web because people figured out how useful they are and how easy they are to write. I'm writing my own because I'd rather create one than bother to use someone else's. I suggest you do the same. It's fun.
